                ORI Tarot is a tarot card application that allows you to create simple "3-card" readings.
                From the home page, you are presented with a traditional three-card spread. Each card can be
                flipped to show a card applicable to your past, present, or future.  If you want to keep your readings,
                you can save them to your accout to review later.  You can also refresh a reading if you want to start over.
                To view all your readings (with the date and time of the reading), just navigate to User Readings.  Tarot 
                reading can be a great way to engage in some sustained introspection.

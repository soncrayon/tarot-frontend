            <p>
                ORI Tarot is a tarot card application that allows you to create simple "3-card" readings.
                From the home page, you are presented with a traditional three-card spread. Each card can be
                flipped to show a card applicable to your past, present, or future.  If you want to keep your readings,
                you can save them to your accout to review later.  You can also refresh a reading if you want to start over.
                To view all your readings (with the date and time of the reading), just navigate to User Readings.

                Views on tarot reading vary. For me, there isn't anything nefarious or occult in tarot card reading.  
                It can be a lot like meditation in that it provides a physical start point for some sustained introspection
                and goal setting.  Enjoy!
